# Local Car Market Analyzer

## The Story Behind
I've been struggling with choosing a car lately, mostly due to the poor search experience a certain resource in my area is providing.
The goal of this project is to extract car data from the website for a specific area, and fill my local database (MySQL) with the following information for each car:
- make
- model
- year
- mileage
- price

As of Mar 15, 2023 I was able to pull **26,013** records.  
The next dish on the menu is data analysis.  
A brief aggregation showed that I can afford a 5 y.o. Chevrolet Cruze or Hyundai Elantra üßê
